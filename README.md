# E-Commerce-Sales

Data Import: Import your e-commerce sales data into Power BI. This could include data such as sales transactions, customer information, product details, etc. 

Data Modeling: Create relationships between different tables if necessary. For example, relate sales transactions to customer data and product data.

Create Key Metrics: Identify key metrics you want to track, such as total sales, number of orders, average order value, conversion rate, etc. Use DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to calculate these metrics.

Design the Dashboard: Now it's time to design the dashboard. Arrange visualizations in a meaningful way to provide insights at a glance. Here are some ideas for visualizations:

Line charts or area charts to show trends in sales over time.
Bar charts to compare sales performance across different products or categories.
Pie charts to visualize the distribution of sales by region or customer segment.
KPI (Key Performance Indicator) cards to highlight important metrics like total sales, average order value, etc.
Geographic maps to visualize sales distribution by region.

Interactivity: Add interactivity to the dashboard to allow users to explore the data further. You can use slicers, filters, and drill-down functionality to let users focus on specific time periods, product categories, or customer segments.

Formatting and Styling: Pay attention to formatting and styling to make the dashboard visually appealing and easy to understand. Use consistent color schemes and fonts, and remove unnecessary clutter.
